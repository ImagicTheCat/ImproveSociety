# Improving Society

This project is about improving our society, as if we were improving a program. 

Issues are used to discuss things before writing them down (ideally you should always write them down in the repo, because it will be the only thing decentralized) or to point out errors.

By submitting ideas to this project, you accept that they could be used by anyone to improve society, there is no place for ego or interests here.

This project shouldn't be managed by one person, so feel free to fork, clone and modify it. This repository is only my version of the project.

Proposals (formulated ideas) will be organized as files in directories for clarity, each directory representing a field or a sub-field to work on, all inside the `proposals/` directory.

Feel free to submit pull requests, but remember that this is not a centralized project, if there is a conflict between two people, you can add your ideas in a new proposal (a new file) or by creating a fork if your pull request is not accepted.

The `ideas/` directory is for random ideas that you feel interesting but not well formulated, organized like the proposals. Eventually, you could move the idea to proposals.

Proposals and ideas are written in markdown, in the most possible universal notation.

The `resources/` directory is for adding any data used in the proposals/ideas (like pictures or any kind of data).
